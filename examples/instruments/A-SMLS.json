      "summary": "The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas is the home of the NASA WB-57 High Altitude Research Program. Three fully operational WB-57 aircraft are based near JSC at Ellington Field. The aircraft have been flying research missions since the early 1970's, and continue to be an asset to the scientific community with professional, reliable, customer-oriented service designed to meet all scientific objectives.The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. Two crew members are positioned at separate tandem stations in the forward section of the fuselage. The pilot station contains all the essential equipment for flying the aircraft while the sensor equipment operator (SEO) station contains both navigational equipment and controls for the operation of the payloads that are located throughout the aircraft. The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload.",

  "summary": "The National Research Council decadal survey for earth science identified the need for a Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM) to address crucial issues on how changes in atmospheric composition affect the quality and well-being of life on earth. The baseline GACM instrument suite comprises UV/Vis and IR/SWIR spectrometers and an advanced microwave limb sounder working together to retrieve atmospheric composition worldwide with high spatial resolution. The Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder (SMLS) is designed to meet the measurement requirements of GACM by providing complete orbit-to-orbit retrieval of O3, N2O, temperature, water vapor, CO, HNO3, ClO, and volcanic SO2 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Unlike previous MLS instruments that only scanned the limb vertically leaving large orbit to orbit gaps, SMLS will simultaneously scan both in azimuth and elevation providing complete global coverage with 6 or more repeat measurements per day. SMLS will employ extremely sensitive, broadband, sideband-separating, SIS receivers centered at 230 and 640 GHz that provide the same precision as those on Aura MLS with a 100 fold reduction in integration time. SMLS will use a novel antenna design that provides high vertical resolution and enables rapid horizontal scanning of the field of view.Since the late summer 2008, the development of the SMLS instrument technology has been underway within NASA Earth Science Technology Office\u2019s Instrument Incubator Program. The objective of this development is to advance the core signal path technologies required for a microwave limb sounder with the capability to map the composition of the upper troposphere and stratosphere with 50x50x1 km spatial sampling and six times daily mid-latitude repeat coverage. The specific goals of this effort include:* the mitigation of the optics and calibration risks of the SMLS flight sensor design by constructing and testing an airborne prototype of the SMLS sensor and calibration system - A-SMLS - using prototype sideband-separating mixers, line sources, and advanced spectrometers and calibration targets;* the mitigation of the development risks of the cryogenics system by developing a flight-like cryostat and demonstrating an end-to-end prototype of the SMLS signal path from the antenna interface through the back-end electronics, and quantifying its stability, calibration accuracy, linearity, and sensitivity; and* the demonstration of the potential science measurement capability of SMLS through the A-SMLS science flights.",
