      "summary": "NASA operates two ER-2 aircraft as readily deployable high altitude sensor platforms to collect remote sensing and in situ data on earth resources, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation. Operating at 70,000 feet (21.3 km) the ER-2 acquires data above ninety-five percent of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The aircraft also yields an effective horizon of 300 miles (480 km) or greater at altitudes of 70,000 feet. Consequently, ER-2 sensors acquiring earth imagery or conducting atmospheric sounding replicate spatial, spectral and atmospheric characteristics of data collected by earth observing sensors aboard orbiting satellites.",

  "summary": "The NO2-ClO-ClONO2-BrO instrument is composed of two separate instruments: A laser-induced fluorescence instrument for the detection of NO2 and a thermal dissociation/resonance fluorescence instrument for the detection of ClO, ClONO2 and BrO.The NO2 detection system uses laser-induced resonance fluorescence (LIF) for the direct detection of NO2. Ambient air passes through a detection axis where the output of a narrow bandwidth (0.06 cm-1), tunable dye laser operating near 585 nm is used to excite a rovibronic transition in NO2. The excited NO2 molecules are either quenched by collision with air or fluorescence. The NO2 fluorescence is strongly red-shifted, with emission occurring over a broad range of wavelengths from 585 nm to the mid-infrared. The specificity of the technique is accomplished by tuning the laser frequency on and off resonance with a narrow spectral feature (0.04 cm-1) in the NO2 absorption spectrum. The difference between the fluorescence signal on and off resonance is related to the mixing ratio of NO2 through laboratory and in-flight calibrations. The observations are determined with an accuracy (1 sigma) of \u00b110% \u00b150 pptv, precision (1 sigma) of \u00b140 pptv, and a reporting interval of 10 seconds. Higher resolution (0.25 sec) data available on request.The halogen detection system uses gas-phase thermal dissociation of ambient ClONO2 to produce ClO and NO2 radicals. The pyrolysis is accomplished by passing the air sampled in a 5-cm-square duct through a grid of resistively heated silicon strips at 10 to 20 m/sec, rapidly heating the air to 520 K. The ClO fragment from ClONO2 is converted to Cl atoms by reaction with added NO, and Cl atoms are detected using ultra-violet resonance fluorescence at 118.9 nm. A similar detection axis upstream of the heater provides simultaneous detection of ambient ClO. An identical twin sampling duct provides the capability for diagnostic checks. The flight instrument is calibrated in a laboratory setting with known addition of ClONO2 as a function of pressure, heater temperature and flow velocity. The concentration of ClONO2 is measured with an accuracy and detection limit of \u00b120% and 10 pptv, respectively, in 35 seconds (all error estimates are 1 sigma). The concentration of ClO is measured with an accuracy and detection limit of \u00b117% and 3 pptv, respectively, in 35 seconds.",
