  "summary": "The PFP whole air sampler provides a means of automated or manual filling of glass flasks, twelve per PFP. The sampler is designed to remove excess water vapor from the sampled air and compress it without contamination into ~1-liter volumes. These flasks are analyzed at the NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Division laboratory for trace gasses and at \u00a0the INSTAR\u2019s Staple Isotope Lab laboratory for isotopes of methane. More than 60 trace gases found in the global atmosphere can be measured at mole fractions that range from parts-per-million (10 -6 ), e.g., carbon dioxide, down to parts-per-quadrillion (10 -15 ), e.g., HFC-365mfc. \u00a0The chemical species monitored include N 2 O, SF 6 , H 2 , CS 2 , OCS, CO 2 , CH 4 , CO, CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, Solvents, Methyl Halides, Hydrocarbons and Perfluorocarbons.",
