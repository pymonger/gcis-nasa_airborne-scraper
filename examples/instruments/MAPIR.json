      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates the NASA Airborne Science Program's P-3 Orion research aircraft to support airborne science research.  Wallops Flight Facility has operated the P-3 since 1991 in support of a variety of scientific studies including ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, cryospheric research, oceanography, soil science, biology, and satellite calibration/validation. The P-3 is also used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. The P-3 is a self-sufficient global reaching aircraft that can operate from civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies.The P-3 is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for endurance and range and is capable of long duration flights. The P-3 has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. Aircraft features include zenith ports, three nadir ports (aft of the wings), and eight P-3 and DC-8 style windows to mount experiments, a tail cone, nose radome and ten mounting locations on the wings. Most of the fuselage ports are contained within the pressurized cabin environment. The unpressurized bomb bay can be converted into experimenter ports via a custom fairing. This fairing creates two large nadir ports and several oblique ports for installation of large sensors and antennas.A project data system is located on the aircraft and provides aircraft data and video throughout the cabin. This system is also connected to two satellite constellations and provides uplink/downlink capability, internet access, flight tracking, and instant messaging between other aircraft and ground assets. Several sensors are connected to the project data system to provide meteorological and aircraft positional data to experimenters. An engineering data system is also integrated into the aircraft along with an air data boom to gather pertinent flight test data to determine effects of installations on the aircraft\u2019s flight envelope.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective platforms for airborne research.",

  "summary": "The Marshall Airborne Polarimetric Imaging Radiometer (MAPIR) is a dual beam, dual angle polarimetric, scanning L band passive microwave radiometer system developed by the Observing Microwave Emissions for Geophysical Applications (OMEGA) team at MSFC. MAPIR observes naturally-emitted radiation from the ground primarily for remote sensing of land surface brightness temperature from which we can retrieve soil moisture and possibly surface or water temperature and ocean salinity.MAPIR consists of an electronically steered phased array antenna comprised of 81 receiving patch elements and associated electronics to provide the required beam steering capability. The antenna produces two independent beams that can be individually scanned to any user-defined scan angle. The antenna is connected to four microwave radiometers and a microwave spectrum analyzer. Two radiometers operate over a narrow band (science band) between 1400-1427 MHz. Two other radiometers operate over a wider bandwidth (1350-1450 MHz) and are used for Radio Frequency interference (RFI) surveillance. The outputs of the four radiometers are routed to the digital back end module that digitizes and filters the signal into 16 well isolated spectral sub-bands and computes the first four statistical moments in each sub-band from which the radio brightness temperature and kurtosis (a statistical measure, indicative of RFI) can be computed in post-processing.MAPIR can operate in two user-selectable modes: Single-Beam Dual (simultaneous) Polarization and Dual (simultaneous) Beam Single Polarization. In the first mode, both beams of the antenna are directed to scan to the same angle, but the radiometers are observing orthogonal polarizations (horizontal and vertical) at the same time. In the second mode, the two antenna beams can be directed to different azimuth and/or angles and the radiometers observe the same polarization at the same time. The instrument is capable of electronic beam steering to one-degree of resolution from 0-40 degrees in elevation and 0-360 degrees azimuth in both beams. MAPIR precision is 0.01K and brightness temperature accuracy is 5 degrees K accuracy over a 10 ms integration interval, but is capable of achieving 0.5K sensitivity over a 1 second integration interval. Near-term improvements to MAPIR will bring that accuracy to 3 K over a 10 ms integration period.",
