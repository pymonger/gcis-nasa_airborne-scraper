  "summary": "NIRSPEC detects shock emissions in the range 0.96 - 1.67 micron and measures blackbody continuum in the near-Infrared where the blackbody continuum peaks at lower temperatures.The instrument consists of an InGaAs camera with a 600 l/mm objective grating. The InGaAs camera detects stars of about J-magnitude +2, meteors of about magnitude -1. The co-aligned intensified camera detects stars of magnitude +6.",
