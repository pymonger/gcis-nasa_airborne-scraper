      "summary": "NASA operates two ER-2 aircraft as readily deployable high altitude sensor platforms to collect remote sensing and in situ data on earth resources, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation. Operating at 70,000 feet (21.3 km) the ER-2 acquires data above ninety-five percent of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The aircraft also yields an effective horizon of 300 miles (480 km) or greater at altitudes of 70,000 feet. Consequently, ER-2 sensors acquiring earth imagery or conducting atmospheric sounding replicate spatial, spectral and atmospheric characteristics of data collected by earth observing sensors aboard orbiting satellites.",

  "summary": "Instrument: FSSP-300 Aerosol SpectrometerPrincipal Investigator: Guy V. FerryOrganization:NASA-Ames Research CenterM.S. 245-5Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000Principal Investigators: James E. Dye (303) 497-8944 Darrel Baumgardner (303) 497-1054 FAX (303) 497-8181 Organization: National Center for Atmospheric Research 1850 Table Mesa Drive Boulder, Co 80307 Principle of Operation: The Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) Model 300 sizes particles by measuring the amount of laser light scattered from angles of 4 to 12&degree; by aerosol particles in situ as they pass through a focused laser beam. Comparison of voltage outputs from the signal detector and a masked slit detector is used to electro-optically define the sample area. Fig. 1 shows the configuration of the instrument. The instrument system is composed of two parts: (l) a Particle Measuring Systems model FSSP-300 aerosol spectrometer, and (2) a data acquisition and recording system. The FSSP-300 aerosol spectrometer is located on the front of the starboard spear pod of the ER-2. The data acquisition and recording system is part of the package that houses the FPCAS aerosol spectrometer located in the bottom, rear portion of the starboard spear pod of the ER-2. The FSSP-300 aerosol spectrometer sizes particles in the 0.4 to 20 micron diameter size range (depending on the refractive index of the aerosol particles measured) in the free air stream outside the ER-2. The measured particles are divided into 31 size intervals with more resolution at smaller sizes.Detection Limit: 0.4 to 20 micrometers diameter Sampling Rate: 0.1 Hertz Location on ER-2: Nose of right pod.
