      "summary": "The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas is the home of the NASA WB-57 High Altitude Research Program. Three fully operational WB-57 aircraft are based near JSC at Ellington Field. The aircraft have been flying research missions since the early 1970's, and continue to be an asset to the scientific community with professional, reliable, customer-oriented service designed to meet all scientific objectives.The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. Two crew members are positioned at separate tandem stations in the forward section of the fuselage. The pilot station contains all the essential equipment for flying the aircraft while the sensor equipment operator (SEO) station contains both navigational equipment and controls for the operation of the payloads that are located throughout the aircraft. The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload.",

  "summary": "The Fast In situ Stratospheric Hygrometer (FISH), developed at the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich (Germany), is based on the Lyman-a photofragment fluorescence technique. Details of the instrument and the calibration procedure are described in Z\u00f6ger et al. [1999]. FISH has been used in several campaigns both from balloon and aircraft and compared with a large number of other hygrometers [Kley et al., 2000].FISH consists of a closed, vacuum-tight fluorescence cell, a Lyman-a radiation source, a PMT in photon-counting mode, detectors to monitor the VUV radiation output of the Lyman-a lamp, and a mirror drive that controls the measuring cycle (see diagram): determination of the fluorescence and background count rate and of the lamp intensity. With a measurement frequency of 1 Hz, the noise equivalent mixing ratio at 3 ppmv is 0.2-0.15 ppmv, and the detection limit is 0.18-0.13 ppmv.FISH is calibrated between flights in the laboratory using a calibration bench under realistic conditions, that is varying the H2O mixing ratio of the test air from a few ppmv to several hundred ppmv and the pressure from 1000 to 10 hPa. A frost point hygrometer is used as a reference instrument. The overall accuracy of FISH measurements is 5-6 %.",
