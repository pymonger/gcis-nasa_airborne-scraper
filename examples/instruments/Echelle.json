  "summary": "The miniature Echelle spectrograph provides gigh-resolution Echelle spectroscopy, whereby the spectral range (360 - 900 nm) is folded into shorter segments and projected on a CCD camera for simultaneous exposure.This instrument consists of a 100 mm f4.5 UV Nikkor lens and Catalina Scientific Corp. \"Echellette\" Spectrograph with Visible Module or UV Module coupled to a Q-Imaging \"Intensified Retiga\" blue-enhanced image intensified CCD camera.Scientific objective: Spectral resolution of shock layer radiation. Resolve spectral lines of air plasma emissions at optical wavelengths for the measurement of excitation temperatures. Provide highest possible spectral resolution.",
