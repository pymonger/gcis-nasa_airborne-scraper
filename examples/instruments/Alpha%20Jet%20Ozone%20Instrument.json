      "summary": "The Alpha Jet is a modified tactical strike fighter developed by Dassault-Breguet and Dornier through a German-French NATO collaboration (DO-AJET). The aircraft is owned and operated by H211, LLC and is based at and operated from Moffett Field, CA under a Space Act Agreement with NASA Ames Research Center. The aircraft operates under an FAA Experimental Certificate of Airworthiness, has updated avionics as well as a payload management and control system. The primary payload compartments are re-purposed wing pod fuel tanks.",

  "summary": "Alpha Jet (O 3 ) Ozone instrument detailsMeasurements of ozone (O 3 ) mixing ratios are performed using a commercial O 3 monitor (2B Technologies Inc., model 205 ( http://www.twobtech.com/model_205.htm )) based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption techniques and modified for flight worthiness. The dual-beam instrument uses two detection cells to simultaneously measure UV light intensity differences between O 3 -scrubbed air and un-scrubbed air to give precise measurements of O 3 . The monitor has been modified by upgrading the pressure sensor and pump to allow measurements at high altitudes, including a lamp heater to improve the stability of the UV source, and the addition of heaters, temperature controllers and vibration isolators to control the monitor\u2019s physical environment.Ozone inletThe air intake is through Teflon tubing (perfluroalkoxy-polymer, PFA) with a backward-facing inlet positioned on the underside of the instrument wing pod. Air is delivered through a 5 \u00b5m PTFE (polytetrafluroethylene) membrane filter to remove fine particles prior to analysis.Ozone instrument calibrations:The O 3 monitor has undergone thorough instrument testing in the laboratory to determine the precision, linearity and overall accuracy. Eight-point calibration tests (ranging from 0 \u2013 300 ppbv) are typically performed before and after each flight using an O 3 calibration source (2B Technologies, model 306 referenced to the WMO scale). The calibration of all 2B Technologies Ozone Calibration Sources is traceable to NIST through an unbroken chain of comparisons and is sent back to the vendor annually for calibration. Calibrations in a pressure- and temperature-controlled environmental chamber have also been carried out using the O 3 calibration source over the pressure range 200 - 800 mbar and temperature range -15 to +25 \u2070C; typical pressure and temperature ranges observed in the wing-mounted instrument pod during flight.",
