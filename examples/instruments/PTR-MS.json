      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates two NASA C-130H Hercules research aircraft to support airborne scientific research activities. The C-130H is used to perform scientific research, provide logistics support on an as-needed basis to other airborne science missions, and can be used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. These aircraft are also available to support range surveillance and recovery operations as needed. The C-130H is a self-sufficient aircraft that can operate from short field civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies and other operations.The C-130H is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for maximum payload capacity. The C-130H, NASA 439, has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. The aircraft has two large nadir ports. One nadir port is approximately 50 inches in diameter (pressurized) and the other nadir port is approximately 24 inches in diameter (unpressurized). A large removable side fuselage plug exists on the port side of the aircraft just forward of the wings. An experimental power system is installed in the aircraft as well as a variety of other small fuselage ports. The aircraft also is capable of carrying 5 cargo pallets that can be utilized to carry cargo or modified to support instrument racks and seats. The large rear cargo door allows for easy installation of large instruments and payloads. The aircraft is equipment with external fuel tanks to increase range and duration.The C-130H, NASA 436, is currently under modification to support future airborne science research needs.The performance numbers presented below are based on a 20,000lb payload. Heaiver payload may reduce aircraft range and duration.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost effective platforms for airborne research and other flight activities.",

  "summary": "PTR-MS is a state-of-the-art chemical ionization mass spectrometry technique that allows for fast (seconds) and highly sensitive (detection limits in the tens of pptv range) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A detailed description of the measurement principle and the instrument can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-transfer-reaction_mass_spectrometryThe technique was developed in the mid-1990s at the University of Innsbruck in Austria and has since then become a routine and integral part of most tropospheric chemistry field campaigns including INDOEX 1999, SOS 1999, TEXAQS 2000, AOE 2001, BEWA 2002, ECHO 2003, ARCTAS-2008, DISCOVER-AQ 2011 \u2013 just to name a few of the campaigns in which the University of Innsbruck measurement team has been involved.
