  "summary": "The NOAA NOyO3 4-channel chemiluminescence (CL) instrument will provide in-situ measurements of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), total reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy), and ozone (O3) on the NASA DC-8 during the Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC4RS) project. This instrument has previously flown on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft on multiple field projects since 1995. It offers fast-response, specific, high precision, and calibrated measurements of nitrogen oxides and ozone at a spatial resolution of better than 100m at typical DC-8 research flight speeds. Detection is based on the classic gas-phase CL reaction of NO with O3 at low pressure, resulting in photoemission from electronically excited NO2. Photons are detected and quantified using pulse counting techniques, providing ~5 to 10 part-per-trillion by volume (pptv) precision at 1 Hz data rates. One CL channel of the integrated 4-channel instrument is used to measure ambient NO directly, a second channel is equipped with a high-power UV-LED converter to photodissociate ambient NO2 to NO, and a third channel is equipped with a heated gold catalyst to reduce ambient NOy species to NO. Reagent ozone is added to these sample streams to drive the CL reactions with NO. Ambient O3 is detected in the fourth channel by adding reagent NO.",
