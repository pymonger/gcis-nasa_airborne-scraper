      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates two NASA C-130H Hercules research aircraft to support airborne scientific research activities. The C-130H is used to perform scientific research, provide logistics support on an as-needed basis to other airborne science missions, and can be used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. These aircraft are also available to support range surveillance and recovery operations as needed. The C-130H is a self-sufficient aircraft that can operate from short field civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies and other operations.The C-130H is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for maximum payload capacity. The C-130H, NASA 439, has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. The aircraft has two large nadir ports. One nadir port is approximately 50 inches in diameter (pressurized) and the other nadir port is approximately 24 inches in diameter (unpressurized). A large removable side fuselage plug exists on the port side of the aircraft just forward of the wings. An experimental power system is installed in the aircraft as well as a variety of other small fuselage ports. The aircraft also is capable of carrying 5 cargo pallets that can be utilized to carry cargo or modified to support instrument racks and seats. The large rear cargo door allows for easy installation of large instruments and payloads. The aircraft is equipment with external fuel tanks to increase range and duration.The C-130H, NASA 436, is currently under modification to support future airborne science research needs.The performance numbers presented below are based on a 20,000lb payload. Heaiver payload may reduce aircraft range and duration.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost effective platforms for airborne research and other flight activities.",

  "summary": "An inlet collects ambient air from the free air stream and adds reagents, including O2 or N2 dilutents, and NO and SO2 reagent gases.  This method, called \"oxygen dilution modulation\" leads to nearly 100% measurement of HO2 and RO2 in the O2 dilution/low reagent concentration mode, whereas RO2 is measured with less than 10% efficiency in the N2 dilution/higher reagent concentration mode. This is because the chemistry converts peroxy radicals to H2SO4 efficiently in the O2 mode, but RO2 radicals are converted to RONO in the N2 mode.  The H2SO4 thus produced is ionized by reaction with NO3- ions.  The reagent and product ions are detected by mass spectrometry using quadrupole mass filtering and counting by a channel electron multiplier operating in the negative ion mode.",
