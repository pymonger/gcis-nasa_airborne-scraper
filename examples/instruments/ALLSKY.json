  "summary": "ALLSKY is a wide field intensified camera with all-sky lens. It measures total radiative output in the 400 - 900 nm band.This camera consists of a 15 mm f2.8 Canon lens, an XX1332 image intensifier with large 48-mm photocathode, and a Sony handycam camcorder (recording of video output on Hi-8 tape in NTSC format - 640 x 480 pixels). The field of view is about 160\u00ba when mounted so that the dome does not obstruct. Moonlight is blocked by covering the zenith part of the dome.",
