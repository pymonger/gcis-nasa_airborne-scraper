      "summary": "University Technical Services, Inc. operates a twin-engine Cessna 402B aircraft for low altitude sensor platforms and scientific equipment. One area involves enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) sensor and synthetic vision system (SVS) evaluation. The aircraft has mulitiple nose coses for housing various windows for IR, millimeter wave, and UV forward-looking sensors, whose images are displayed on a head-up display (HUD) or head-down display, with simultaneous recording of three inputs (sensor/SVS, HUD, CCD normal vision camera). Data recording of aircraft attitude and position information is provided by the mission computer. The Cessna 402B also supports evaluation of other scientific equipment platforms such as advanced inertial management units (IMU). Air-ground video and data link communication capabilities are also supported on this aircraft.",

      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates the NASA Airborne Science Program's P-3 Orion research aircraft to support airborne science research.  Wallops Flight Facility has operated the P-3 since 1991 in support of a variety of scientific studies including ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, cryospheric research, oceanography, soil science, biology, and satellite calibration/validation. The P-3 is also used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. The P-3 is a self-sufficient global reaching aircraft that can operate from civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies.The P-3 is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for endurance and range and is capable of long duration flights. The P-3 has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. Aircraft features include zenith ports, three nadir ports (aft of the wings), and eight P-3 and DC-8 style windows to mount experiments, a tail cone, nose radome and ten mounting locations on the wings. Most of the fuselage ports are contained within the pressurized cabin environment. The unpressurized bomb bay can be converted into experimenter ports via a custom fairing. This fairing creates two large nadir ports and several oblique ports for installation of large sensors and antennas.A project data system is located on the aircraft and provides aircraft data and video throughout the cabin. This system is also connected to two satellite constellations and provides uplink/downlink capability, internet access, flight tracking, and instant messaging between other aircraft and ground assets. Several sensors are connected to the project data system to provide meteorological and aircraft positional data to experimenters. An engineering data system is also integrated into the aircraft along with an air data boom to gather pertinent flight test data to determine effects of installations on the aircraft\u2019s flight envelope.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective platforms for airborne research.",

  "summary": "TSI Integrating Nephelometers are designed specifically for studies of direct radiative forcing of the Earth\u2019s climate by aerosol particles, or studies of ground-based or airborne atmospheric visual air quality in clean areas. They may also be used as an analytical detector for aerosol particles whenever the parameter of interest is the light-scattering coefficient of the particles after a pretreatment step, such as heating, humidification, or segregation by size. The light-scattering coefficient is a highly variable aerosol property. Integrating Nephelometers measure the angular integral of light scattering that yields the quantity called the aerosol scattering coefficient, which is used in the Beer-Lambert Law to calculate total light extinction.",
