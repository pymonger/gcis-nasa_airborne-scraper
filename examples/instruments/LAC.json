      "summary": "NASA operates two ER-2 aircraft as readily deployable high altitude sensor platforms to collect remote sensing and in situ data on earth resources, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation. Operating at 70,000 feet (21.3 km) the ER-2 acquires data above ninety-five percent of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The aircraft also yields an effective horizon of 300 miles (480 km) or greater at altitudes of 70,000 feet. Consequently, ER-2 sensors acquiring earth imagery or conducting atmospheric sounding replicate spatial, spectral and atmospheric characteristics of data collected by earth observing sensors aboard orbiting satellites.",

  "summary": "The Large Area Collectors are flown on the ER-2 in support of the NASA-Johnson Space Flight Center Cosmic Dust Program. The LACs are used to collect comparatively unaltered cosmic dust from the stratosphere at ER-2 flight altitudes of 65,000 feet and above. Sufficient quantities of extraterrestrial materials are collected to allow chemical and mineralogical compositions of individual particles to be determined. Study of these materials whose sources may be comets, asteroid collisions, planetary impacts, and meteorite ablation provide valuable information about the origin and the history of the solar system.",
