  "summary": "The UNHMERC instrument provides detailed information on atmospheric mercury. Measurements of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and gaseous elemental mercury (Hg\u00b0) are performed simultaneously with one minute time resolution using a custom four-channel atomic fluorescence spectrometer. The relative amount of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM = HgCl2 + HgBr2+ HgOBr + \u2026) will be assessed through careful examination of the difference between TGM and Hg\u00b0. TGM is defined as the sum Hg\u00b0 + RGM. Targeted aerosol sampling will also be conducted for particulate-phase mercury (HgP).",
