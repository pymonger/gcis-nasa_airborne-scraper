      "summary": "The NASA Langley Beechcraft B200 King Air (NASA 529) is an all-metal, twin-turboprop research aircraft. NASA Langley acquired this aircraft in 1996 for program support. The aircraft has been modified with two nadir-viewing ports: 29.5 x 29.5-in. in the forward section of the passenger cabin and 26.75 x 22.5 in. in the aft section. These downward-looking portals allow the use of a wide variety of optical, laser, or R-F based devices that might require a nadir look angle out of the aircraft. Research-supporting subsystems, such as electrical power distribution, TCAS, GPS and satellite phone communications also have been installed. The crown of the aircraft has been structurally modified to accommodate atmospheric sensors, such as an isokinetic aerosol inlet. Finally, a pylon has been mounted beneath each wingtip. These pylons are suitable for carrying aerosol probes with weights of up to 50 lbs. In its current configuration, the aircraft serves as the primary flight platform for a suite of aerosol and cloud remote-sensing instruments, including the NASA Langley High Spectral Resolution LIDAR (HSRL). The aircraft is fully IFR capable.The research power system contains three 50-A AC inverters which supply up to 4200 W of research power. An Iridium satellite phone system has been installed to facilitate both remote voice communications as well as data modem transfer.This aircraft nominally flies mission profiles up to altitudes of 28,000 ft, but with prior coordination, is capable of conducting operations in the National Airspace System up to the aircraft's service ceiling of 35,000 ft. Typically, the aircraft can carry a 1000-lbs payload, three crewmembers (two flight crew and one system operator) and remain airborne for four hours covering approximately 800 n.mi. The aircraft is limited to a maximum certified takeoff weight of 13,500 lbs. The aircraft has successfully operated in both domestic and international deployments. In summary, the NASA Langley B200 aircraft and its flight team provide an efficient and effective operational platform for small to medium-sized science payloads, especially those requiring or desiring unique integration, dedicated flight profiles, coordinated flights with other platforms, or flight patterns in congested airspace.",

  "summary": "The NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) is used to characterize clouds and small particles in the atmosphere, called aerosols. From an airborne platform, the HSRL scientist team studies aerosol size, composition, distribution and movement.The HSRL instrument is an innovative technology that is similar to radar; however, with lidar, radio waves are replaced with laser light. Lidar allows researchers to see the vertical dimension of the atmosphere, and the advanced HSRL makes measurements that can even distinguish among different aerosol types and their sources. The HSRL technique takes advantage of the spectral distribution of the lidar return signal to discriminate aerosol and molecular signals and thereby measure aerosol extinction and backscatter independently.The HSRL provides measurements of aerosol extinction at 532 nm and aerosol backscatter and depolarization at 532 and 1064 nm. The HSRL measurements of aerosol extinction, backscattering, and depolarization profiles are being used to:1) characterize the spatial and vertical distributions of aerosols 2) quantify aerosol extinction and optical thickness contributed by various aerosol types 3) investigate aerosol variability near clouds 4) evaluate model simulations of aerosol transport 5) assess aerosol optical properties derived from a combination of surface, airborne, and satellite measurements.",
