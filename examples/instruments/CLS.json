      "summary": "NASA operates two ER-2 aircraft as readily deployable high altitude sensor platforms to collect remote sensing and in situ data on earth resources, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation. Operating at 70,000 feet (21.3 km) the ER-2 acquires data above ninety-five percent of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The aircraft also yields an effective horizon of 300 miles (480 km) or greater at altitudes of 70,000 feet. Consequently, ER-2 sensors acquiring earth imagery or conducting atmospheric sounding replicate spatial, spectral and atmospheric characteristics of data collected by earth observing sensors aboard orbiting satellites.",

  "summary": "The CLS is flown on the ER-2 to conduct cloud radiation and severe storm field experiments. Designed to operate at high altitudes in order to obtain measurements above the highest clouds, the instrument provides the true height of cloud boundaries and the density structure of less dense clouds. The height structure of cirrus, cloud top density and multiple cloud layers may also be profiled. The system specifications are as follows:Laser Type: \tNd:YAG I,II Wavelength: \t1064, 532 nanometer Pulse Energy: \t90, 30 mJ Pulse repetition frequency: \t10 Hz Beam width: \t1 mradDiameter: \t0.15 m Beam width: \t1.4 mrad Polarization: \tvert. and horiz.Sample rate: \tMeasurements at 20 m intervals at 200 m/s aircraft speed Range Resolution: \t7.5 m Number of Channels: \t4 Samples per Channel: \t3310 Record Capacity: \t8 hours",
