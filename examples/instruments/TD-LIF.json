  "summary": "The UC Berkeley thermal-dissociation laser-induced fluorescence (TD- LIF) instrument detects NO2 directly and detects total peroxynitrates (\u03a3PNs \u2261 PAN + PPN +N2O5 + HNO4. . .), total alkyl- and other thermally stable organic nitrates (\u03a3ANs), and HNO3 following thermal dissociation of these NOy species to NO2. The sensitivity for NO2 at 1 Hz is 30 pptv (S/N=2) with a slope uncertainty of 5%. The uncertainties for the dissociated species are 10% for \u03a3PNs and 15% for \u03a3ANs and HNO3.",
