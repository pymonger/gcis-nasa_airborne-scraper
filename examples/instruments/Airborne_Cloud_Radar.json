      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates the NASA Airborne Science Program's P-3 Orion research aircraft to support airborne science research.  Wallops Flight Facility has operated the P-3 since 1991 in support of a variety of scientific studies including ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, cryospheric research, oceanography, soil science, biology, and satellite calibration/validation. The P-3 is also used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. The P-3 is a self-sufficient global reaching aircraft that can operate from civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies.The P-3 is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for endurance and range and is capable of long duration flights. The P-3 has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. Aircraft features include zenith ports, three nadir ports (aft of the wings), and eight P-3 and DC-8 style windows to mount experiments, a tail cone, nose radome and ten mounting locations on the wings. Most of the fuselage ports are contained within the pressurized cabin environment. The unpressurized bomb bay can be converted into experimenter ports via a custom fairing. This fairing creates two large nadir ports and several oblique ports for installation of large sensors and antennas.A project data system is located on the aircraft and provides aircraft data and video throughout the cabin. This system is also connected to two satellite constellations and provides uplink/downlink capability, internet access, flight tracking, and instant messaging between other aircraft and ground assets. Several sensors are connected to the project data system to provide meteorological and aircraft positional data to experimenters. An engineering data system is also integrated into the aircraft along with an air data boom to gather pertinent flight test data to determine effects of installations on the aircraft\u2019s flight envelope.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective platforms for airborne research.",

  "summary": "The utility of millimeter-wave radars have been successfully used for cloud sensing and cloud microphysical studies. Studies of the impact of cloud feedbacks on the earth's radiation budget have underscored the importance of having a means of measuring the vertical distribution of clouds. Millimeter-wave radars can provide this information under most conditions, with high resolution, using a relatively compact system.The Airborne Cloud Radar (ACR) for profiling cloud vertical structure was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts in 1996. It is a W-band (95 GHz) polarimetric Doppler radar designed as a prototype airborne facility for the development of the 94 GHz Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) for NASA CloudSat mission.The ACR is a third-generation millimeter-wave cloud radar. While adopting the well tested techniques used by its predecessors, ACR also has a number of new features including an internal calibration loop, frequency agility, digital I and Q demodulation, digital matched filtering, and a W-band low-noise amplifier.",
