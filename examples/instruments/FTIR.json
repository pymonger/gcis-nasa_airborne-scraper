  "summary": "The absorption of infrared solar radiation along a slant path to the sun is recorded from 2 to 15 micrometers.  Six spectral filters are used to cover the region from 2-15 microns.  An interferogram is recorded in about 10 seconds. Interferograms are transformed to produce spectra.  Column amounts are retrieved by fitting the observed spectra using the non-linear least squares fitting code SFIT2 that employs an Optimal Estimation retrieval algorithm.The major chlorine reservoirs (HCl and ClONO2), the important nitrogen-containing gases in the stratosphere (N2O, NO, NO2, and HNO3), stratospheric and tropospheric tracers (HF, CH4, C2H6, H2O, CO2), a major source CFC (CF2Cl2) and ozone may be routinely retrieved.",
