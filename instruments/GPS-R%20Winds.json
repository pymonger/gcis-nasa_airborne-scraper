      "summary": "The NASA Langley Beechcraft B200 King Air (NASA 529) is an all-metal, twin-turboprop research aircraft. NASA Langley acquired this aircraft in 1996 for program support. The aircraft has been modified with two nadir-viewing ports: 29.5 x 29.5-in. in the forward section of the passenger cabin and 26.75 x 22.5 in. in the aft section. These downward-looking portals allow the use of a wide variety of optical, laser, or R-F based devices that might require a nadir look angle out of the aircraft. Research-supporting subsystems, such as electrical power distribution, TCAS, GPS and satellite phone communications also have been installed. The crown of the aircraft has been structurally modified to accommodate atmospheric sensors, such as an isokinetic aerosol inlet. Finally, a pylon has been mounted beneath each wingtip. These pylons are suitable for carrying aerosol probes with weights of up to 50 lbs. In its current configuration, the aircraft serves as the primary flight platform for a suite of aerosol and cloud remote-sensing instruments, including the NASA Langley High Spectral Resolution LIDAR (HSRL). The aircraft is fully IFR capable.The research power system contains three 50-A AC inverters which supply up to 4200 W of research power. An Iridium satellite phone system has been installed to facilitate both remote voice communications as well as data modem transfer.This aircraft nominally flies mission profiles up to altitudes of 28,000 ft, but with prior coordination, is capable of conducting operations in the National Airspace System up to the aircraft's service ceiling of 35,000 ft. Typically, the aircraft can carry a 1000-lbs payload, three crewmembers (two flight crew and one system operator) and remain airborne for four hours covering approximately 800 n.mi. The aircraft is limited to a maximum certified takeoff weight of 13,500 lbs. The aircraft has successfully operated in both domestic and international deployments. In summary, the NASA Langley B200 aircraft and its flight team provide an efficient and effective operational platform for small to medium-sized science payloads, especially those requiring or desiring unique integration, dedicated flight profiles, coordinated flights with other platforms, or flight patterns in congested airspace.",

      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates the NASA Airborne Science Program's P-3 Orion research aircraft to support airborne science research.  Wallops Flight Facility has operated the P-3 since 1991 in support of a variety of scientific studies including ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, cryospheric research, oceanography, soil science, biology, and satellite calibration/validation. The P-3 is also used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. The P-3 is a self-sufficient global reaching aircraft that can operate from civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies.The P-3 is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for endurance and range and is capable of long duration flights. The P-3 has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. Aircraft features include zenith ports, three nadir ports (aft of the wings), and eight P-3 and DC-8 style windows to mount experiments, a tail cone, nose radome and ten mounting locations on the wings. Most of the fuselage ports are contained within the pressurized cabin environment. The unpressurized bomb bay can be converted into experimenter ports via a custom fairing. This fairing creates two large nadir ports and several oblique ports for installation of large sensors and antennas.A project data system is located on the aircraft and provides aircraft data and video throughout the cabin. This system is also connected to two satellite constellations and provides uplink/downlink capability, internet access, flight tracking, and instant messaging between other aircraft and ground assets. Several sensors are connected to the project data system to provide meteorological and aircraft positional data to experimenters. An engineering data system is also integrated into the aircraft along with an air data boom to gather pertinent flight test data to determine effects of installations on the aircraft\u2019s flight envelope.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective platforms for airborne research.",

  "summary": "Estimation of surface wind speed by matching the shape of the reflected GPS signal correlation function against analytical models. Wind speed obtained from this method has agreed with that recorded from buoys with a bias of less than 0.1 m/s, and with a standard deviation of 1.3 m/s.A modified GPS receiver is used to track the direct line of sight satellites through a zenith-oriented right hand circularly polarized (RHCP) antenna and record the cross-correlation function of the reflected signals using a nadir-oriented left hand circularly polarized (LHCP) antenna. The cross-correlation for one or two satellites is continuously recorded in 10 to 12 range bins. Accumulation is done in hardware for an integration time of 1 ms. Batches of 0.1 seconds of the sum square of the inphase and quadrature components are then averaged before being saved to disk.",
