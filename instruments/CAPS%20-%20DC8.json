  "summary": "This multipurpose particle spectrometer includes three Droplet Measurement Technologies instruments plus temperature and relative humidity sensors that are packaged into a single, integrated measurement system. The CAPS provides the following data:- Aerosol particle and cloud hydrometeor size distributions from 0.51 to 50 \u00b5m- Precipitation size distributions from 25 \u00b5m to 1550 \u00b5m, or 15-930 um with optional 15-micron resolution- Particle optical properties (refractive index)- Particle shape assessments (discrimination between water and ice for probes with depolarization feature)- Liquid water content from 0.01 to 3 g/m3- Aircraft velocity- Atmospheric temperature and pressureThis instrument replaces the older PMS/PMI FSSP-100, FSSP-300, 2D-C, 2D-P and KLWC and can be used in many applications, including weather modification, aircraft icing, hurricane and storm research, and agricultural and industrial spray characterization.",
