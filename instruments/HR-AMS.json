      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates two NASA C-130H Hercules research aircraft to support airborne scientific research activities. The C-130H is used to perform scientific research, provide logistics support on an as-needed basis to other airborne science missions, and can be used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. These aircraft are also available to support range surveillance and recovery operations as needed. The C-130H is a self-sufficient aircraft that can operate from short field civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies and other operations.The C-130H is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for maximum payload capacity. The C-130H, NASA 439, has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. The aircraft has two large nadir ports. One nadir port is approximately 50 inches in diameter (pressurized) and the other nadir port is approximately 24 inches in diameter (unpressurized). A large removable side fuselage plug exists on the port side of the aircraft just forward of the wings. An experimental power system is installed in the aircraft as well as a variety of other small fuselage ports. The aircraft also is capable of carrying 5 cargo pallets that can be utilized to carry cargo or modified to support instrument racks and seats. The large rear cargo door allows for easy installation of large instruments and payloads. The aircraft is equipment with external fuel tanks to increase range and duration.The C-130H, NASA 436, is currently under modification to support future airborne science research needs.The performance numbers presented below are based on a 20,000lb payload. Heaiver payload may reduce aircraft range and duration.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost effective platforms for airborne research and other flight activities.",

  "summary": "Principle: The CU aircraft version of the Aerodyne High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) detects non-refractory submicron aerosol composition by impaction on a vaporizer at 600\u00b0C, followed by electron ionization and time-of-flight mass spectral analysis. Size-resolved composition can be quantified by measuring the arrival times of the aerosol at the vaporizer.Aircraft Operation: (1 min cycles, can be adjusted to meet mission goals): 46 s total concentration measurements (1 s resolution) 5 s size distribution measurements 9 s Background + OverheadData Products: Aerosol Mass Concentrations: Organic aerosol (OA) , SO 4 , NO 3 , NH 4 , Chloride OA Chemical Markers: f 44 (Secondary OA), f 57 (hydrocarbon-like OA), f 60 (biomass burning OA), f 82 (isoprene epoxide-SOA) All products are available in real-time More advanced products: - O/C, H/C, OA/OC - Particle organic nitrates (RONO 2 ) - Ammonium Balance, estimated pH - OA components by positive matrix factorizationDetection Limits (1s, ng sm -3 ) : Sulfate: 30 Nitrate: 60 Ammonium: 20 Chloride: 70 OA: 700 For detailed OA analysis, longer averaging (3-30 s, depending on OA concentration) is needed. A 1 min product is hence available as well.",
