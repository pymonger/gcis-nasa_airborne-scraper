      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates the NASA Airborne Science Program's P-3 Orion research aircraft to support airborne science research.  Wallops Flight Facility has operated the P-3 since 1991 in support of a variety of scientific studies including ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, cryospheric research, oceanography, soil science, biology, and satellite calibration/validation. The P-3 is also used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. The P-3 is a self-sufficient global reaching aircraft that can operate from civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies.The P-3 is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for endurance and range and is capable of long duration flights. The P-3 has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. Aircraft features include zenith ports, three nadir ports (aft of the wings), and eight P-3 and DC-8 style windows to mount experiments, a tail cone, nose radome and ten mounting locations on the wings. Most of the fuselage ports are contained within the pressurized cabin environment. The unpressurized bomb bay can be converted into experimenter ports via a custom fairing. This fairing creates two large nadir ports and several oblique ports for installation of large sensors and antennas.A project data system is located on the aircraft and provides aircraft data and video throughout the cabin. This system is also connected to two satellite constellations and provides uplink/downlink capability, internet access, flight tracking, and instant messaging between other aircraft and ground assets. Several sensors are connected to the project data system to provide meteorological and aircraft positional data to experimenters. An engineering data system is also integrated into the aircraft along with an air data boom to gather pertinent flight test data to determine effects of installations on the aircraft\u2019s flight envelope.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective platforms for airborne research.",

  "summary": "The DFGAS instrument utilizes a room temperature infrared (IR) laser source based upon non-linear difference frequency generation (DFG) in the measurement of CH2O.Mid-IR laser light is generated in the DFG system by mixing the output of two near-IR room temperature laser sources (one at 1562-nm and the other at 1083-nm) in a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) non-linear wavelength conversion crystal. The mid-IR difference frequency at 2831.6 cm-1 (3.53-\u03bcm) is generated at the PPLN output and directed through a multipass astigmatic Herriott cell (100-m pathlength using ~ 4-liter sampling volume) and ultimately onto IR detectors employing a number of optical elements. A portion of the IR beam is split off by a special beam splitter (BS) before the multipass cell and focused onto an Amplitude Modulation Detector (AMD) to capture and remove optical noise from various components in the difference frequency generation process. A third detection channel from light emanating out the back of the beam splitter is directed through a low pressure CH2O reference cell and onto a reference detector (RD) for locking the center of the wavelength scan to the absorption line center. The mid-IR DFG output is simultaneously scanned and modulated over the CH2O absorption feature, and the second harmonic signals at twice the modulation frequency from the 3 detectors are processed using a computer lock-in amplifier [Weibring et al. [2006].Ambient air is continuously drawn through a heated rear-facing inlet at flow rates around 9 standard liters per minute (slm), through a pressure controller, and through the multipass Herriott cell maintained at a constant pressure around 50-Torr. Ambient measurements are acquired in 1-second increments for time periods as long as 60 to 120-seconds (to be determined during the campaign), and this will be followed by 15-seconds of background zero air acquisition, using an onboard CH2O scrubbing unit. The zero air is added back to the inlet a few centimeters from the tip at flow rates ~ 2 to 3 slm higher than the cell flow. This frequent zeroing procedure very effectively captures and removes optical noise as well as residual outgassing from inlet line and cell contaminants. Retrieved CH2O mixing ratios are determined for each 1-second ambient spectrum by fitting to a reference spectrum, obtained by introducing high concentration calibration standards (~ 3 to 7-ppbv) from an onboard permeation calibration system into the inlet approximately every hour. The calibration outputs for the two permeation tubes employed are determined before and after the field campaign using multiple means, including direct absorption employing the Beer-Lambert Law relationship. The 1-second ambient CH2O results can be further averaged into longer time intervals for improved precision. However, in all cases the 1-second results are retained. This flexibility allows one to further study pollution plumes with high temporal resolution, and at the same time study more temporally constant background CH2O levels in the upper troposphere using longer integration times.",
