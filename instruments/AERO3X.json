      "summary": "The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) Aircraft Office operates the NASA Airborne Science Program's P-3 Orion research aircraft to support airborne science research.  Wallops Flight Facility has operated the P-3 since 1991 in support of a variety of scientific studies including ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, cryospheric research, oceanography, soil science, biology, and satellite calibration/validation. The P-3 is also used as a technology test bed for new airborne and satellite instrumentation. The P-3 is a self-sufficient global reaching aircraft that can operate from civilian and military airports to remote areas of the world in support of scientific studies.The P-3 is a four-engine turboprop aircraft designed for endurance and range and is capable of long duration flights. The P-3 has been extensively modified to support airborne science related activities. Aircraft features include zenith ports, three nadir ports (aft of the wings), and eight P-3 and DC-8 style windows to mount experiments, a tail cone, nose radome and ten mounting locations on the wings. Most of the fuselage ports are contained within the pressurized cabin environment. The unpressurized bomb bay can be converted into experimenter ports via a custom fairing. This fairing creates two large nadir ports and several oblique ports for installation of large sensors and antennas.A project data system is located on the aircraft and provides aircraft data and video throughout the cabin. This system is also connected to two satellite constellations and provides uplink/downlink capability, internet access, flight tracking, and instant messaging between other aircraft and ground assets. Several sensors are connected to the project data system to provide meteorological and aircraft positional data to experimenters. An engineering data system is also integrated into the aircraft along with an air data boom to gather pertinent flight test data to determine effects of installations on the aircraft\u2019s flight envelope.The Aircraft Office is committed to providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective platforms for airborne research.",

  "summary": "Aerosols (particulate matter) have a dramatic effect on radiative forcing of the climate, in some cases cooling and in other cases warming. The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC estimates that direct radiative forcing due to all aerosols is a cooling of -0.50 W m-2 with absorbing aerosol (black carbon) responsible for a warming of +0.22 W m-2, but the uncertainties associated with these numbers are very large. Better measurements of the optical properties of aerosols, especially absorption coefficient and asymmetry parameter, and their spatial and temporal distribution are required to reduce these uncertainties and improve the ability of models to predict climate change. Aero3X was designed to provide such measurements. It is a light weight (11 kg), compact (0.25 x 0.30 x 0.6 m), and fast (1 Hz sample rate) instrument intended for use on an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) but suitable for flight on other aircraft and for surface measurements. Aero3X uses an off-axis cavity ring-down technique to measure extinction coefficient and a reciprocal nephelometry technique for measurement of total-, forward- and back-scatter coefficients at wavelengths of 405 nm and 675 nm. Its outstanding precision (0.1 Mm-1) and sensitivity (0.2 Mm- 1) allow the determination of absorption coefficient, single-scattering albedo, estimates of backscatter to extinction ratio and asymmetry parameter at both wavelengths, and Angstrom exponent. Together with its humidification system for measurement of the dependence of aerosol optical properties on relative humidity, these represent a complete set of the aerosol optical properties important to climate and air quality. Aero3X was designed to operate in pollution plumes where NO2 may cause interference with the measurement, therefore, a measurement of NO2 mixing ratio is also made.",
