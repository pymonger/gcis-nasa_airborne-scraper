      "summary": "NASA operates two ER-2 aircraft as readily deployable high altitude sensor platforms to collect remote sensing and in situ data on earth resources, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation. Operating at 70,000 feet (21.3 km) the ER-2 acquires data above ninety-five percent of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The aircraft also yields an effective horizon of 300 miles (480 km) or greater at altitudes of 70,000 feet. Consequently, ER-2 sensors acquiring earth imagery or conducting atmospheric sounding replicate spatial, spectral and atmospheric characteristics of data collected by earth observing sensors aboard orbiting satellites.",

  "summary": "The Itek Iris II Panoramic Camera has been employed to acquire high resolution land use and land cover data. The Forest Service has used this camera extensively for assessing timber resources and monitoring gypsy moth defoliation in the Appalachian hardwood forests. The Iris II provides a 4.5 x 34.7 inch (11.4 x 88.1 cm) image covering 2.0 x 21.4 miles (3.2 x 34.2 km) on the ground. The high resolution twenty-four inch lens provides a scale at nadir on the panoramic image of half-mile to the inch. With its 10,000 foot film capacity the Iris II allows extended flight duration allowing photography acquisition over very large areas.",
