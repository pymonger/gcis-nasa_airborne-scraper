      "summary": "NASA operates two ER-2 aircraft as readily deployable high altitude sensor platforms to collect remote sensing and in situ data on earth resources, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes. The aircraft also are used for electronic sensor research and development, satellite calibration and satellite data validation. Operating at 70,000 feet (21.3 km) the ER-2 acquires data above ninety-five percent of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The aircraft also yields an effective horizon of 300 miles (480 km) or greater at altitudes of 70,000 feet. Consequently, ER-2 sensors acquiring earth imagery or conducting atmospheric sounding replicate spatial, spectral and atmospheric characteristics of data collected by earth observing sensors aboard orbiting satellites.",

  "summary": "Hycon HR-732 cameras are used to acquire high resolution photography in a 9 x 18 inch format. These cameras can be flown in pairs or one camera may be paired with an RC-10 mapping camera. The HR-732s acquire high resolution photography with twenty-four inch focal length lenses providing an image scale of half-mile to the inch. The large scale high resolution photography provided by these cameras is used by agencies such as the Forest Service for timber resource management and by the Fish and Wildlife Service for wetlands inventories and wildlife habitat mapping.",
