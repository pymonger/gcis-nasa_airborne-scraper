      "summary": "The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas is the home of the NASA WB-57 High Altitude Research Program. Three fully operational WB-57 aircraft are based near JSC at Ellington Field. The aircraft have been flying research missions since the early 1970's, and continue to be an asset to the scientific community with professional, reliable, customer-oriented service designed to meet all scientific objectives.The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. Two crew members are positioned at separate tandem stations in the forward section of the fuselage. The pilot station contains all the essential equipment for flying the aircraft while the sensor equipment operator (SEO) station contains both navigational equipment and controls for the operation of the payloads that are located throughout the aircraft. The WB-57 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours, has a range of approximately 2500 miles, and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload.",

  "summary": "The NOAA PALMS instrument (Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry) will measure single-particle aerosol composition aboard the NASA DC-8 during the DC3 and SEAC4RS campaigns. PALMS will provide a variety of size-dependent compositional tracers to identify aerosol sources, probe mixing state, and investigate convective transport and cloud processing. PALMS has over 130 successful flights aboard the WB-57, DC-8, and NOAA P-3 aircrafts and a history of seminal publications (e.g., Murphy et al., 2006).Aerosol particles are brought into a vacuum system via a series of aerosol focusing stages. Particles are detected by light scattered from two consecutive 532 nm laser beams where their aerodynamic diameter is measured. A scattering event triggers a vaporizing and ionizing pulse from a 193 nm excimer laser. Ions are analyzed using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Each detected particle produces one complete positive or negative mass spectrum. Background signal intensities from air are < 0.1% of the aerosol ion signal. The PALMS size range is approximately 200-3000 nm and encompasses a large fraction of aerosol volume. Aerosol data rates are typically ~1 Hz, but data can be acquired at up to 10 Hz. PALMS maintains an effective data rate in the upper troposphere even for very low aerosol loadings, < 0.01 \u03bcg/m3.The PALMS mass spectra allow individual aerosol particles to be classified into broad compositional categories: sulfate-organic mixtures, biomass burning, elemental carbon, mineral dust, sea salt, meteoric, industrial, and oil combustion. These primary data products are used to characterize aerosol sources along the aircraft flight track. PALMS size-dependent composition can be combined aerosol counting instruments to generate quantitative, composition-resolved aerosol volume.",
